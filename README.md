This is project which I created to grab the nutritional information of the products on sale at supermarkets, and to use this information to rank the products on useful metrics,
such as the healthiest foods with the bast bang per buck. I had to put this on hold as I found that the data supplied through the Tesco API was more patchy than I anticipated,
and thus the limited nutritional rankings schemes available did not produce insightful information. However, there should still be value to this approach as this data (and nutritional science)
continues to improve.
